# UML Design Explanations for CHMS

## 1. Alert Generation System
The Alert Generation System is responsible for continuously monitoring patient vital signs and generating alerts when values exceed personalized thresholds. These thresholds differ per patient; for example, one patient might have an alert trigger if their heart rate exceeds 130 beats per minute, while another may have a different limit. To keep the system modular and easy to maintain, three main classes handle different aspects of alerting. The AlertGenerator evaluates the real-time data against patient-specific thresholds and creates an Alert object that captures the patient ID, the condition that triggered the alert, and a timestamp. Then, the AlertManager routes these alerts to medical staff through appropriate communication channels, ensuring that critical conditions receive timely attention. This separation of concerns supports adding new alert types or changing alert dispatch methods without affecting core evaluation logic. Furthermore, patient data privacy is carefully managed so only necessary information is exposed during alert processing, protecting sensitive details.

## 2. Data Storage System
The Data Storage System manages all incoming cardiovascular data securely and efficiently. Each data point, represented as a PatientData record, includes timestamped vitals linked to a patient, enabling both real-time monitoring and historical trend analysis. The system incorporates data retention policies to delete old records after a certain period, balancing storage limits and privacy needs. A DataRetriever component allows authorized users to query patient data by different criteria like patient ID or date ranges. Separating storage and retrieval ensures that changes to the storage backend don’t affect how data is accessed. Access control mechanisms safeguard sensitive data by restricting retrieval to authorized personnel only.

## 3. Patient Identification System
The Patient Identification System ensures incoming data matches the correct patient record. It uses identifiers from the incoming stream and matches them to hospital records via the PatientIdentifier class. If no match is found or inconsistencies arise, the IdentityManager handles these exceptions, ensuring data integrity and preventing misattribution. The system clearly separates patient data representation (HospitalPatient), matching logic, and error handling, improving clarity and maintainability. This approach allows future improvements to the matching process without impacting other parts of the system. Additionally, patient information is handled carefully to restrict access and maintain privacy, aligning with healthcare data protection standards.

## 4. Data Access Layer
The Data Access Layer acts as the interface between the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System and external data sources such as TCP streams, WebSocket connections, or file logs. This layer uses an abstract DataListener interface implemented by specialized classes like TCPDataListener, WebSocketDataListener, and FileDataListener, each handling the specifics of their respective data sources. This abstraction allows the system to easily incorporate new data sources in the future without modifying other components. When raw data arrives, it is processed by a dedicated DataParser that converts varying input formats—such as JSON or CSV—into a consistent internal representation that the system can work with uniformly. The DataSourceAdapter then takes the parsed data and forwards it to the storage system for long-term management.
